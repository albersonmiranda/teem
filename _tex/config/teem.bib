	abstract = {Does arts integration contribute to student success for disadvantaged student populations? The introduction to this article compares students’ academic performance and arts education in countries outperforming the United States on the recent Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ({TIMSS}) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ({PIRLS}) and makes the argument for using arts integration as a way to teach the Common Core standards and align instruction to the Universal Design for Learning principles. This evaluation of research helps to support the evidence base by examining the quality of studies published between 1995 and 2011 investigating the use of arts integration with disadvantaged student populations, including economically disadvantaged students, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Four hundred fifty-three studies were explored, resulting in the inclusion of forty-four studies in this analysis. Studies were categorized as the following: single art integration, multi-arts integration, effects of arts integration on students with disabilities, or effects of arts integration on school climate. Studies were evaluated for their research design, implementation, and effects, and results depicted positive effects and potentially positive effects. Policy implications and suggestions for future research using the author's proposed theoretical framework are also discussed.},

It relied on Machado's (2011) Network of Meanings and characterized as state-of-the-art research, it comprised three methodological stages: Stage 1 consisted of a literature survey on the relationship between Mathematics and Music. In Stage 2, the exploration of this material was conducted, and typical characteristics and approaches and perspectives of these productions were defined. Stage 3 consisted of the analysis of these data, and systematization through a network of meanings of the relationships between Mathematics and Music. It is expected to contribute to present potentialities and limitations and central characteristics of research that deal with this theme, for the identification of theoretical and practical contributions to the fields of research and teaching.},

	volume = {11},
	doi = {10.4102/sajce.v11i1.899},
	abstract = {Background: Mathematics education is a significant issue in the South African context. Learners’ achievement levels are markedly low as suggested by both national and international studies. The teaching and learning of fractions in particular have been identified as challenging.

Aim: The aim of this article is to share some of the outcomes derived from a series of lessons in which aspects of music (note values) were integrated into the teaching of fractions in primary school.

Setting: The study was conducted in a Grade 5 class in an independent school in the Eastern Cape, with readily available resources at hand.

Methods: The broader study was an action research case study. It employed qualitative methods of data collection, based on cycles of critical reflection and adjustment, including feedback from learners and critical peers.

Results: Findings highlighted the value of integrating music and mathematics as a teaching and learning strategy. Learning support materials and activities that promoted curriculum integration were designed. The discussion highlights benefits of these integrated lessons.

Conclusion: We conclude by suggesting that teachers explore synergistic opportunities across mathematics and music as subjects. In particular, we suggest curriculum integration to support the teaching of fractions in the primary grades of schooling. Our hope is that this article will encourage teachers to develop their own integrated strategies for enriching their teaching of mathematics.},
